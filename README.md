This is a top-down 2D space shooter. The player controls a spaceship that can fire laser shots, missiles and plasma shots. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible by destroying enemies and avoiding asteroids.

The player has a supply of health, armor, fuel, ammunition and missiles, which are displayed on the screen. He can collect bonuses, such as health kits, to replenish resources. There is also a score system for counting enemies destroyed.

Enemies regularly spawn in waves and attack the player. There are several types of enemies: regular flying enemies, kamikaze enemies, and enemies that drop drones. Enemies shoot at the player and try to deal damage.

There are also randomly scattered asteroids that absorb shots. The player must control the ship, shoot, dodge and survive as long as possible.

The game has a menu, a level restart system and the ability to exit to the main menu. The overall goal is to score as many points as possible by destroying enemies and surviving as long as possible.
